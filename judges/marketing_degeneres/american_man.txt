Fox’s Family Guy (cartoon)

	Centers around the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois, their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie, and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. Set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, the show exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.

NBC’s The Office (sitcom)

	Depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The series was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track, to mirror the look of an actual documentary.

Comedy Central’s Workaholics (sitcom)


	The main characters met at college, where Blake and Adam were roommates and Anders was their RA. They continued their college behavior as they settled into adulthood, such as drinking, partying, and pulling pranks. A self-proclaimed "friendship family", the trio's schemes are generally confined to their house in Rancho Cucamonga, California, where they often interact with their drug dealer, and a cubicle they share in the office of the telemarketing company TelAmeriCorp, where they clash with their boss and coworkers.

Fox’s American Dad (cartoon)

	Focuses on the eccentric upper middle class Smith family in a fictionalized version of Langley, Virginia and their four housemates: Father, husband, CIA agent, Republican, and breadwinner Stan; his wife and homemaker/housewife, Francine; their liberal, hippie, college-aged daughter, Hayley; and their dorky high-school-aged son, Steve. There are four additional main characters, including Hayley's boyfriend and later husband, Jeff Fischer; the family's unusual goldfish, Klaus, who has the brain of an East German athlete; Roger, the alien, who is a flamboyant, hedonistic, self-serving master of disguise; and Roger's ex-tumor son Rogu. Stan's boss Avery Bullock, the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is a recurring character.

History Channel’s Pawn Stars (Reality TV)

	Chronicles the daily activities at the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, a 24-hour family business opened in 1989. Depicts the staff's interactions with customers, which consist of buying, selling, and pawning artifacts; haggling over the price, and discussing the artifacts' historical background, with narration provided by either the Harrisons or Chumlee.

AMC’s Breaking Bad (Drama)

	Takes place in New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010. Follows Walter White, a struggling, frustrated high school chemistry teacher who becomes a crime lord in the local meth drug trade, driven to provide for his family financially after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of an extremely pure, blue meth which creates high demand.

HBO’s Game of Thrones (Drama)

	Roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The series follows several simultaneous plot lines. The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

HBO’s The Sopranos (Drama)

	Follows Tony Soprano, a North Jersey-based Italian-American mobster, who tries to balance his family life with his role as the boss of the Soprano family. Suffering from anxiety-induced panic attacks, he reluctantly engages in therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi throughout the series.
