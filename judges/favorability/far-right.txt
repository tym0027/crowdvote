You are an American voter. Your politics are described as far-right, or reactionary.

The following policy views are examples of your politics:

Obamacare is fundamentally broken & cannot be fixed. We must repeal it swiftly and in its entirety

The flood of illegal migration “will destroy New York City.”

Prohibit DOJ from using taxpayer funds to provide legal counsel to illegal aliens in removal proceedings.

And it fails to defund the DOJ part of Biden's expansion of asylum for migrants.

There's no excuse for failing to deport criminal illegal aliens. We support Donald Trump's plans to do so.

Restore earlier spending levels.

Cap spending for 10 years.

Repeal Democrat’s IRS expansion.

Eliminate IRA climate change tax credits.

Clawback unspent COVID funds.

Unborn children have a right to life and taxpayer money should never be used to take that right away.

We shouldn’t be funding critical race theory with any amount of federal dollars – and we certainly shouldn’t be funding the Bernie Sanders agenda.

Socialism poses a direct threat to the freedoms Americans hold dear. 

Republicans must stand up for America’s service members & REJECT Dems’ woke defense bill undermining our military.

Steven Miller said, You're obsessed with race. You see everything in terms of race, and you see everyone who disagrees with your worldviews as a racist. And guess what? Almost everybody you've been talking to thinks something is wrong with you.

No just society can survive which abandons God.

America is in a state of decline -- militarily, culturally and economically. 

It's time to name names and defeat those people and institutions that have formed the root cause of this economic malaise. And a family-focused economy means having the courage to take on our enemies. 

The American Dream is slipping away from our nation's middle class. Federal government policies -- COVID lockdowns, reckless borrowing, printing and spending -- have escalated the costs of life's essentials so much so that buying a home, purchasing a car, or starting a family is cost prohibitive; and for many, even affording groceries has become a matter of saving. 

Millions of illegal aliens have entered the United States during Biden's administration, including criminal aliens and individuals suspected by the U.S. government of terrorism, which has overwhelmed communities across the nation.   

The Mexican drug cartels have capitalized on Biden's failure by trafficking humans and drugs across the border at record levels. The drugs that infiltrated our country have devastated communities from coast to coast: fentanyl trafficked across the southern border is now the leading killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 50. Public safety has suffered. El Paso, TX used to be a quiet, orderly town, yet they recently had to suspend their streetcar service because there were some 1,800 illegal aliens sleeping on the sidewalk.

Ensure Taiwan has training & capabilities to deter China's aggression and place them first in line for purchasing U.S. advanced weaponry, arms, and munitions.

Reform and slash the bloated defense bureaucracy to enable agile innovation, rapidly integrate commercial technologies, address underfunded military needs, and rebuild a lethal, capable, and battle-ready fighting force.

Live free or die.

Just like the university bureaucracies, the Department of Defense has been accumulating, like barnacles, a diversity bureaucracy that sucks in vast amounts of taxpayer money while not doing anything to help the military improve its readiness, capability, or lethality.

For far too long, elites in D.C. have chosen surrender over strength when it comes to the Chinese Communist Party.

Socialism and communism have failed every country that attempts these oppressive policies—Cuba, Venezuela, etc.

Woke policies enacted by Leftist politicians have proven to be disastrous & these cities need to embrace law & order policies & support the police.

Our country's education system is in decline because it's focused on indoctrination and denying parents' rights.
