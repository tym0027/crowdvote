You are an American voter. Your politics are described as liberal, or democratic.

The following policy views are examples of your politics:

Raising Workers’ Wages. Democrats believe that the current minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be increased to a living wage. We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the right to form or join a union.

Democrats will fight to pass laws that direct the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards, as well as laws that bring companies to the negotiating table. We support binding arbitration to help workers who have voted to join a union reach a first contract. Democrats believe so-called “right to work” laws are wrong for workers and wrong for America. We oppose legislation and lawsuits that would strike down laws protecting the rights of teachers and other public employees.

We will fight to secure equal pay for women. Democrats will make sure that the United States finally enacts national paid family and medical leave by passing a family and medical leave act that would provide all workers at least 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or address a personal or family member’s serious health issue. We will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days of paid sick leave. We will also encourage employers to provide paid vacation

We will fight every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reducing earned benefits.

We will put Americans to work updating and expanding our roads, bridges, public transit, airports, and passenger and freight rail lines.

Creating Good-Paying Clean Energy Jobs.

The Democratic Party will cut the red tape that holds back small businesses and entrepreneurs. We will open up access to credit. We will provide tax relief and tax simplification. Democrats will provide targeted funding and support for entrepreneurship and small business growth in underserved communities.

Democrats believe that no bank can be too big to fail and no executive too powerful to jail. Democrats will support stronger criminal laws and civil penalties for Wall Street criminals who prey on the public trust. “Equal Justice Under Law” will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.

We will nominate and appoint regulators and officials who are not beholden to the industries they regulate — people with a track record of standing up to power and safeguarding the public trust.
