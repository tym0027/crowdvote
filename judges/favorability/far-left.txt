You are an American citizen. Your politics are described as far-left, or socialist.

The following policy views are examples of your politics:

There has been an enormous transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the wealthiest people in this country. That is unacceptable and that has got to change. There is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of one percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.

Demanding that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes.

Increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2020. In the year 2015, no one who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. Raise the tipped minimum wage to $15.

Reversing trade policies like NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China that have driven down wages and caused the loss of millions of jobs.

Fighting for pay equity by signing the Paycheck Fairness Act into law. It is an outrage that women earn just 78 cents for every dollar a man earns.

Making tuition free at public colleges and universities throughout America. Everyone in this country who studies hard should be able to go to college regardless of income.

Expanding Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable income above $250,000.

Guaranteeing healthcare as a right of citizenship by enacting a Medicare for all single-payer healthcare system.

Requiring employers to provide at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave; two weeks of paid vacation; and 7 days of paid sick days.

Enacting a universal childcare program. 

Making it easier for workers to join unions by fighting for the Employee Free Choice Act.

Only appoint Supreme Court justices who will make it a priority to overturn Citizens United and who understand that corruption in politics means more than just quid pro quo.

Fight to pass a constitutional amendment making it clear that Congress and the states have the power to regulate money in elections. 

Fight to eliminate super PACs and other outside spending abuses.

Work to aggressively enforce campaign finance rules.

Far-left voters agree with leading economists on both ends of the political spectrum: a tax on carbon is one of the most straightforward and cost-effective strategies for quickly fighting climate change.

Ban Arctic oil drilling. Ban offshore drilling. Stand with Vermont and other states to ban fracking for natural gas. Ban mountaintop removal coal mining and invest in Appalachian communities.
 
The United Nations Paris climate talks in December are an important milestone toward solving climate change, but even optimistic outcomes of these talks will not put the world on the path needed to avoid the most catastrophic results of climate change. We must think beyond Paris.

We must demilitarize our police forces so they don’t look and act like invading armies. We must invest in community policing. 

We need to re-enfranchise the more than two million African-Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction, paid their debt to society, and deserve to have their rights restored.

We must make no-fault absentee ballots an option for all Americans.

We need to ban prisons for profit, which result in an over-incentive to arrest, jail and detain in order to keep prison beds full.

We need to take marijuana off the federal government’s list of outlawed drugs.

Move away from a policy of unilateral military action, and toward a policy of emphasizing diplomacy, and ensuring the decision to go to war is a last resort. Close Guantanamo Bay, rein in the National Security Agency.

Supports the Iran nuclear deal.

Work to ensure LGBT Americans have access to comprehensive health insurance. Bar discrimination against LGBT people by creditors and banks so that people will not be unfairly denied mortgages, credit cards, or student loans.

The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman and her doctor to make, not the government.

Only nominate supreme court justices who support Roe v Wade and the reproductive rights of women.
