Rushing this appointment, especially so close to an election, undermines the very essence of what our forefathers envisioned for the Supreme Court.

Now, what\\’s at stake here is the President\\’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He\\’s been running on that, he ran on that and he\\’s been governing on that. He\\’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court.

So, yes, I said we could see a vaccine sooner than what\\'s been said, and I mean it. We\\'re cutting through the red tape, not the safety procedures, but the bureaucracy that slows things down.

Now, when I say that the vaccine will be distributed very soon, I\\'m talking about having it available to those who need it most as quickly as possible. Dr. Redfield and Dr. Slaoui are both highly respected in their fields, but when it comes to the timing, I\\'m optimistic. I\\'m pushing very hard to get this vaccine out because I know how important it is to the American people. We\\'re going to have it available to the frontline workers, the elderly, and those at highest risk first, and then it will become more widely available.

Many Americans are still out of work, struggling to pay bills, and facing uncertainty. This K-shaped recovery means the gap between the wealthy and everyone else is getting wider.

We need policies that support job creation, provide relief to those who are struggling, and ensure that everyone has a fair shot at success. That\\’s how you make a difference to the American people.

It\\'s about understanding that while some folks are doing well, climbing up, there\\'s a whole lot of people who are being left behind, sliding down. That\\'s not hyperbole; it\\'s a reality for too many Americans. In a K-shaped recovery, the wealthier see their situations improve, often benefiting from a stock market that rebounds quickly, while the middle class and lower-income families continue to struggle with job loss, reduced hours, and the inability to pay bills or afford healthcare. This kind of recovery widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots, exacerbating income and wealth inequality. For the American people, this difference means a lot. If you\\'ve lost your job or your business is struggling, the news about the overall unemployment rate falling doesn\\'t help pay the rent or put food on the table. We need to focus on creating jobs with good wages, supporting small businesses, and ensuring that the recovery reaches everyone, not just those at the top. It\\'s about building back better, with an economy that\\'s more inclusive and resilient. We need to invest in infrastructure, education, clean energy, and manufacturing to create new jobs. We need to make sure healthcare is accessible and affordable for every American. And we need policies that support workers, families, and small businesses, not just big corporations and the wealthy. This is about more than just numbers on a report; it\\'s about people\\'s lives and livelihoods.

What this means for the American people is that not everyone is feeling the recovery in the same way. Some folks are doing better than ever while millions of others are out of work, facing evictions, unable to afford healthcare, and struggling to put food on the table.

But violence is not the answer, and it diverts attention from the real issues of injustice that need to be addressed. As for contacting the Mayor of Portland or the Governor of Oregon, my role has been to offer support and guidance from my position. It\\'s up to local and state officials to manage their law enforcement and public safety responsibilities. However, I have publicly called for the need to address the violence, to engage all stakeholders in dialogue, and to find a peaceful resolution that respects the rights of protesters while protecting public safety. Re-imagining policing means creating a system where law enforcement works with communities, not against them. It\\'s about ensuring public safety in ways that prevent violence, address mental health issues, and rebuild trust between police officers and the communities they serve. This can involve community policing strategies, more resources for mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness issues that don\\'t always require a police response. Regarding community control of policing, I believe communities should have a say in how they are policed. This includes oversight mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability. It\\'s about finding the right balance that keeps communities safe while also respecting the rights and dignity of every citizen.\",\n",

By making new cars more accessible to American families, we're potentially saving thousands of lives due to newer safety technologies being more widely available. However, it's important to note that relaxing these standards doesn't mean we're abandoning efforts to reduce emissions or improve fuel efficiency. On the contrary, we continue to encourage innovation in the auto industry to produce cleaner, more efficient vehicles without sacrificing their performance or making them unaffordable for the average American family. The goal is to achieve environmental benefits without harming our economy or the American worker. We believe in sensible regulations that protect the environment while also supporting economic growth and job creation.\",\n",

And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.\"\n",
