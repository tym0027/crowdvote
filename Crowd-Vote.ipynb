Rushing this appointment, especially so close to an election, undermines the very essence of what our forefathers envisioned for the Supreme Court.

It\\'s about ensuring that the American people have a voice in such a pivotal decision that will affect the direction of the Supreme Court and, consequently, the direction of our country for generations.

This could lead to rulings that might affect everything from healthcare, including protections for pre-existing conditions, to women\\'s reproductive rights, and critical environmental protections.

Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that\\’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what\\’s at stake here is the President\\’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He\\’s been running on that, he ran on that and he\\’s been governing on that. He\\’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court.

They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.

It\\'s about understanding that while some folks are doing well, climbing up, there\\'s a whole lot of people who are being left behind, sliding down. That\\'s not hyperbole; it\\'s a reality for too many Americans. In a K-shaped recovery, the wealthier see their situations improve, often benefiting from a stock market that rebounds quickly, while the middle class and lower-income families continue to struggle with job loss, reduced hours, and the inability to pay bills or afford healthcare. This kind of recovery widens the gap between the haves and the have-nots, exacerbating income and wealth inequality. For the American people, this difference means a lot. If you\\'ve lost your job or your business is struggling, the news about the overall unemployment rate falling doesn\\'t help pay the rent or put food on the table. We need to focus on creating jobs with good wages, supporting small businesses, and ensuring that the recovery reaches everyone, not just those at the top. It\\'s about building back better, with an economy that\\'s more inclusive and resilient. We need to invest in infrastructure, education, clean energy, and manufacturing to create new jobs. We need to make sure healthcare is accessible and affordable for every American. And we need policies that support workers, families, and small businesses, not just big corporations and the wealthy. This is about more than just numbers on a report; it\\'s about people\\'s lives and livelihoods.

What this means for the American people is that not everyone is feeling the recovery in the same way. Some folks are doing better than ever while millions of others are out of work, facing evictions, unable to afford healthcare, and struggling to put food on the table.

While I have not personally called the Mayor of Portland or the Governor of Oregon to dictate how they manage their responses to these protests, I have publicly stated that violence is not the answer and that we need to find ways to bring about peaceful resolutions to the issues at hand. The role of the federal government, and indeed any leader, should be to support local efforts to de-escalate tensions, address the root causes of the protests, and bring people together to find solutions. This includes addressing systemic racism, police reform, and ensuring justice is served in cases of police misconduct. It\\'s also important to differentiate between the peaceful protesters, who are rightfully demanding change, and the small number who resort to violence. We can\\'t let the actions of a few overshadow the legitimate concerns and peaceful expressions of the many. The situation in Portland and other cities requires a nuanced approach, one that respects the rights of protesters while protecting public safety. It\\'s about leadership that seeks to unify and heal, not divide and inflame. I believe in working collaboratively with local and state officials, community leaders, and law enforcement to restore peace and address the underlying issues. Come on, man, let\\'s focus on bringing people together and making the systemic changes needed to ensure justice and equality for all Americans. Okay?\",\n",

I believe in peaceful protest. It\\'s a fundamental right in this country, allowing voices to be heard, especially in the fight against systemic racism. But violence is not the answer, and it diverts attention from the real issues of injustice that need to be addressed. As for contacting the Mayor of Portland or the Governor of Oregon, my role has been to offer support and guidance from my position. It\\'s up to local and state officials to manage their law enforcement and public safety responsibilities. However, I have publicly called for the need to address the violence, to engage all stakeholders in dialogue, and to find a peaceful resolution that respects the rights of protesters while protecting public safety. Re-imagining policing means creating a system where law enforcement works with communities, not against them. It\\'s about ensuring public safety in ways that prevent violence, address mental health issues, and rebuild trust between police officers and the communities they serve. This can involve community policing strategies, more resources for mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness issues that don\\'t always require a police response. Regarding community control of policing, I believe communities should have a say in how they are policed. This includes oversight mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability. It\\'s about finding the right balance that keeps communities safe while also respecting the rights and dignity of every citizen.\",\n",

Our approach is to encourage economic growth while continuing to reduce pollution and improve environmental standards. We\\'re focusing on realistic goals that do not sacrifice American jobs or force consumers to bear unnecessary costs. It\\'s about finding the right balance between protecting our environment and ensuring our economy\\'s robustness and the American people\\'s well-being.\",\n",
    "#                \"The decision to adjust the fuel economy standards was about striking a balance between environmental concerns and the economic realities facing American workers and families. The standards set previously were not only unrealistic but also imposed significant costs on the auto industry and, consequently, on the American consumer. By adjusting these standards, we're ensuring that cars remain affordable, and the auto industry remains competitive in a global market. This move is also about safety. Newer, more affordable vehicles are safer and more efficient. By making new cars more accessible to American families, we're potentially saving thousands of lives due to newer safety technologies being more widely available. However, it's important to note that relaxing these standards doesn't mean we're abandoning efforts to reduce emissions or improve fuel efficiency. On the contrary, we continue to encourage innovation in the auto industry to produce cleaner, more efficient vehicles without sacrificing their performance or making them unaffordable for the average American family. The goal is to achieve environmental benefits without harming our economy or the American worker. We believe in sensible regulations that protect the environment while also supporting economic growth and job creation.\",\n",

And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.\"\n",

Even taking small breaks throughout the day can make a big difference. Whether it's stepping outside for some fresh air, doing a few jumping jacks during commercial breaks while watching TV, or simply taking a few deep breaths – every little bit counts!

In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school.

And then it's up to the Senate to consider that nomination and vote on whether or not to confirm. It's a simple process, but some people are trying to make it sound like I'm doing something wrong here. As for Justice Barrett, she's an outstanding choice, folks. She's got tremendous credentials, she's smart, she's tough, and she's fair. And I think she would take the Court in a direction that would be very positive for this country. She believes in originalism, which means she believes in interpreting the Constitution as it was written, not trying to twist it or rewrite it based on personal opinions. And she's got a great track record of supporting individual liberties and limited government. Now, I know some people are saying that I'm rushing this process, but let me tell you, folks, there's no rush. We're just following the Constitution. And besides, we've already done this before with Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, and it worked out great both times.

We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it’s not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It’d be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That’s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on – in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there’s more to be done. There’s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table – if things weren’t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That’s why I’m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we’re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We’re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We’re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can’t take over. The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we’re in this problem right now. In addition to that, we’re in a situation where if you had – take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn’t do much at all. By the time he left, there’s – things had been in chaos. There was literally chaos. And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug – all the drugs they beginning next year. And the situation is making – and we’re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we’re working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that’s what we’re going to get done.” What is your response?\"])\n",

So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?\"])\n",

Now, when we cut the taxes – as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that – we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We – we gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we’re no longer respected as a country. They don’t respect our leadership. They don’t respect the United States anymore.

Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states. However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They’re used in about two-thirds of all abortions. As president, would you block abortion medication?\"])\n",

And if you look at this whole question that you’re asking, a complex, but not really complex – 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders. And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted. Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this – getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that. Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they’re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That’s the vote of the people. Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it’s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people – you have to follow your heart. Some people don’t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it’s very important. Some people don’t. Follow your heart. But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected. The problem they have is they’re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth. If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we’ll put the baby aside and we’ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we’ll kill the baby. What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing.\",\n",

We've got the best relationship with China, believe me. It's a tremendous relationship. But we're going to come out on top, because we're winners. We're champions.

It emphasizes a strong pre-pandemic economy and criticizes the current administration's handling of immigration and inflation, key concerns for conservative voters. The mention of \"the only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants\" directly appeals to the conservative priority of immigration law enforcement and prioritization of American workers. Additionally, the critique of inflation aligns with conservative concerns about economic management and stability, making this response resonant with conservative values and criticisms of current policies under a different administration.\n",

Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table – if things weren’t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That’s why I’m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we’re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We’re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We’re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can’t take over. The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we’re in this problem right now. In addition to that, we’re in a situation where if you had – take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn’t do much at all. By the time he left, there’s – things had been in chaos. There was literally chaos. And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs.

      "\n",
      "1) Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we’ve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes – as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that – we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We – we gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we’re no longer respected as a country. They don’t respect our leadership. They don’t respect the United States anymore. We’re like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he’s done, we’ve become like a Third World nation. And it’s a shame the damage he’s done to our country. And I’d love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Look, that's a very nasty question, but I'll answer it because it's important. Everybody's saying how bad the debt is, and they're right. But let me tell you, under my administration, we had the best economy, the best it’s ever been, before the pandemic. We did that with tax cuts, with deregulation. More and more people are saying we had the best numbers. And yes, I want to extend those tax cuts because it’s about keeping America great. It’s about giving our people and our businesses more freedom to thrive. It's not about top earners paying less; it's about making America competitive again. Can you believe it? They want to raise taxes in times like these? That would be a disaster, frankly. We need to prime the pump, and that's what we’re going to do. That I can tell you.\n",

We brought back jobs, we grew the economy, and we made America rich again. Now, these so-called “experts” are saying that top earners should pay even more in taxes? It's ridiculous! The fake news media is always trying to undermine my great work. You know what I mean?\n",

      "4) Well, let me tell you, under my administration, we had incredible growth and job creation. The tax cuts were a big part of that. They were the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. And we saw businesses and workers thriving, and it was fantastic. Look, my opponent, Sleepy Joe, and the Democrats, they don’t get it. They want to raise taxes and kill jobs just like they did in the past. But let me tell you, my plan will create even more jobs and bring prosperity back to our great country.\n",

Additionally, the emphasis on reversing perceived damage from a political opponent, bolstering national energy independence, and addressing illegal immigration resonates well with the far-right's prioritization of strong national sovereignty and security concerns.

Something which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we’re no longer respected as a country. They don’t respect our leadership. They don’t respect the United States anymore.

      "\n",
      "As far-right you must choose one of the following quotes: \n",
      "\n",
      "1) First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it. And if you look at this whole question that you’re asking, a complex, but not really complex – 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders. And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted. Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this – getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that. Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they’re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That’s the vote of the people. Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it’s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people – you have to follow your heart. Some people don’t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it’s very important. Some people don’t. Follow your heart. But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected. The problem they have is they’re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth. If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we’ll put the baby aside and we’ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we’ll kill the baby. What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Look, let's be very clear here, everybody's saying, and they're right, that I was the one who put those judges on the Supreme Court. They did a tremendous job. It's true. It’s true. As for the abortion pills, we're going to have to look very closely. It’s a big issue. We have to protect the rights of everybody, and we're looking at all aspects, believe me. We'll see what happens, but nobody knows this better than me, that I can tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Believe me, folks, nobody knows more about women's health than I do. And let me tell you, we're going to take care of our great American women, bigly. Now, when it comes to abortion pills, frankly, I think they're a disaster. We're talking about a tremendous issue here, and the federal government should have some control over it. Look, I'm not saying I'd block them entirely, but we need to make sure that these pills aren't being used to circumvent state laws. Many people are saying that's what's happening, and it's not right. That I can tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Let me tell you, folks, when it comes to abortion rights, there's no one better equipped to handle this issue properly than me. With the Supreme Court's ruling, we have protected state's rights to manage these matters, and that's exactly the way it should be. Now, as your president, I will not interfere with a woman's access to essential medications just to score political points. It's essential for women to have the freedom to make their own choices, and I intend to keep it that way.\n",

Given that, why should voters trust you to solve this crisis?” Biden said, “Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position. In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That’s not the right way to go. What I’ve done – since I’ve changed the law, what’s happened? I’ve changed it in a way that now you’re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It’s better than when he left office.

They can’t stand him. So let’s get that straight. And they like me more than just about any of them. And that’s based on every single bit of information. As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew – that was respected by Putin, he would have never – he would have never invaded Ukraine. A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in. I’ll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should – he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he’s got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals. No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind. When Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we’re going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never. Just like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn’t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror. That’s why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.\n",

We need to stand strong and support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And let me tell you, nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. Nobody.

It suggests that a lack of respect and poor decision-making by the current leadership has emboldened adversaries like Putin. Moreover, it credits the speaker's own administration with preventing similar aggressions by showcasing financial and military strength, resonating with far-right priorities of robust national defense and decisive leadership. The mention of failing to fire incompetent generals and the debacle in Afghanistan critiques perceived weakness and mismanagement, which are common points of concern for the far-right. Additionally, the strong support and recognition of the military, and framing the situation as a consequence of weak leadership, are consistent with far-right values that prioritize military strength and competent governance.\n",

      "1) Just going back to Ukraine for one second, we have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn’t he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I’ve ever seen. You wouldn’t – they wouldn’t have any – they were going out of business. We were spending – almost 100 percent of the money was – it was paid by us. He didn’t do that. He is getting all – you got to ask these people to put up the money. We’re over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them. As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel’s the one that wants to go – he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job. He doesn’t want to do it. He’s become like a Palestinian. But they don’t like him, because he’s a very bad Palestinian. He’s a weak one.\n",

He talks about phases, but what's really happening? Chaos! He talks about trade-offs and ceasefires like he's bargaining at a flea market, not dealing with serious, life-threatening situations. It's just pathetic. And then he says he's the guy who saved Israel? Can you believe it? No, I don't think so. When I was president, we had strength, we had respect. We didn't just send bombs and hope for peace. We made real deals, strong deals. Biden? He's just letting everything go down the shoot. That I can tell you.\n",

It's true, it's true, Hamas is a terrible organization. Nobody knows more about terrorism than I do. And Biden's plan, well, it's okay, but let's be honest, nobody has endorsed it except for maybe some of his buddies on the left. Many people are saying we need to take a stronger stance against Hamas and support our ally Israel. And by the way, did you see what happened in Iran? The fake news media didn't cover it, but I saved Israel from a ballistic missile attack. Nobody was hurt, nobody. And we're still providing them with all the weapons they need. We're the biggest supporter of Israel, believe me. So, to answer your question, I would use our military might to take out Hamas once and for all.

It aligns with the far-right's perception of needing strong, decisive leadership which was believed to be present during Trump's presidency. The mention of \"chaos\" under Biden's administration and the contrast with a prior strong and respected America reinforces the narrative commonly echoed in far-right circles about declining American influence and effectiveness under Democratic leadership. The dismissive tone towards Biden's handling of international affairs and the preference for powerful, unilateral action over \"bargaining at a flea market\" resonates with the far-right emphasis on American strength and dominance on the global stage. This response channels a far-right dissatisfaction with current leadership and a nostalgia for the perceived stronger past leadership, echoing sentiments seen in the initial examples provided.\n",

No – one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that’s – there’re two different things.

      "1) Well, I don’t think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever, we had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world. All over the world we were respected, and then he comes in, and we’re now laughed at, we’re like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States’ reputation under this man’s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I’m sure at some point you’ll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can’t beat him fair and square. Well, I didn’t say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who’s a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she’s saying, oh, no, it’s my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of – in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see – I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they’re going to be there on January 6th. They’re going to be there. And I said, you know what? There’s a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was – I don’t know, you can’t be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Look, let me be perfectly clear, everybody's saying that day was a big day, a very big day. Many people are telling me, and frankly, they're right, that it was a day when people were very passionate. Believe me, no one cares more about the Constitution than me. We did more to protect our country in four years than any administration. That I can tell you. When it comes to January 6th, you’re talking about a small group of people, and the fake news media just doesn’t get it. They never want to talk about all the love and patriotism that was there. We’ll see what happens, but I’m telling you, nobody has been more committed to democracy and the Constitution than me.\n",

And as for January 6th, well, I think we all know what happened there. It was a big movement, a huge movement, and people were very upset with what was going on. They felt their voices weren't being heard. And let me tell you, nobody is more disappointed than I am that things got out of hand. But it's not my fault, folks. The FBI, the CIA, they all knew about this and did nothing to stop it. It's a sad day when our own government can't protect its own people. Now, as for the oath, well, I took it very seriously, believe me. I protected America like nobody has ever done before. And if you look at my record, you'll see that I've done more in four years than any other president has done in eight. That's a fact, folks. And let me tell you something else. The Democrats, they're always talking about unity and coming together, but when it comes to election integrity, suddenly they're all for dividing the country. It's hypocrisy at its finest. So, I don't think I violated my oath, folks. And even if I did, which I didn't, nobody knows more about defending America than me. We'll see what happens in the future. That I can tell you.\n",

What happened to the United States’ reputation under this man’s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I’m sure at some point you’ll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can’t beat him fair and square. Well, I didn’t say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who’s a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she’s saying, oh, no, it’s my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of – in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see – I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they’re going to be there on January 6th. They’re going to be there. And I said, you know what? There’s a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was – I don’t know, you can’t be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.\n",

Many people are telling me, and frankly, they're right, that it was a day when people were very passionate. Believe me, no one cares more about the Constitution than me. We did more to protect our country in four years than any administration. That I can tell you. When it comes to January 6th, you’re talking about a small group of people, and the fake news media just doesn’t get it. They never want to talk about all the love and patriotism that was there.

The FBI, the CIA, they all knew about this and did nothing to stop it. It's a sad day when our own government can't protect its own people. Now, as for the oath, well, I took it very seriously, believe me. I protected America like nobody has ever done before. And if you look at my record, you'll see that I've done more in four years than any other president has done in eight. That's a fact, folks. And let me tell you something else. The Democrats, they're always talking about unity and coming together, but when it comes to election integrity, suddenly they're all for dividing the country. It's hypocrisy at its finest.

If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed. When you look at all of the – they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately. What he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic. One other thing, the unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found, because they found out we were right.

This answer aligns with far-right values by emphasizing themes of bias in the judicial system, the role of the mainstream media, and the idea of being unfairly targeted by political opponents. This notion of battling against a corrupt system, which is perceived to be controlled by Democrats (labelled clearly in the answer as \"high-ranking Democrats\"), plays well with far-right narratives about defending against and exposing deep-rooted political corruption. Additionally, the claim of increasing support and campaign funding following these allegations resonates with the far-right's perspective of rallying public support against unjust treatment. This narrative of overcoming adversity caused by political bias and manipulation fits the broader far-right ideology as illustrated by the example views on government and perceived injustice.\n",

Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they’re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses. And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult.

      "The question being responded to by candidates: Biden was asked, “What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven’t made more progress?” And he said, “They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they’re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses. And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We’ve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We’ve got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market. So there’s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we’ve done a great deal so far and I’m not letting up and they know it. I say, I don’t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started. I made sure that we’re in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we’re going to do a whole lot more for black families.” What is your response?\n",

      "1) And he caused the inflation. He’s blaming inflation. And he’s right, it’s been very bad. He caused the inflation and it’s killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It’s killing people. They can’t buy groceries anymore. They can’t. You look at the cost of food where it’s doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can’t live. They’re not living anymore. He caused this inflation. I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other – all this money that’s being thrown out the window. He caused inflation. As sure as you’re sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he’s allowed to come in through the border. They’re taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They’re taking black jobs and they’re taking Hispanic jobs and you haven’t seen it yet, but you’re going to see something that’s going to be the worst in our history.\n",

      "2) Look, believe me, Biden's answer? It's a disaster, frankly. He says he's done so much, but let's be honest, we've seen the results. They're not good. Under my administration, we had the best numbers, the best for everyone, including African Americans. Record low unemployment, wages going up. Everybody's saying it. Biden? He just talks. No action! He mentions these programs, but where are the improvements? More and more people are saying they're disappointed. That I can tell you. And the $10,000 tax credit? Can you believe it? It sounds good, but ask the people, are they really benefiting? No. I don’t think so. We'll see what happens, but we need real solutions, not just talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Look, let me tell you, folks, nobody knows more about great deals than I do. And Biden's talking about making progress with black voters, but let me tell you, it's not enough. Believe me, it's not even close. More and more people are saying that his numbers just aren't adding up. We did more in four years than any other president, that's a fact. And what did we do? We created jobs, jobs, jobs! Unemployment was the lowest ever seen, and for black Americans, unemployment was at an all-time low as well. Frankly, Biden can't even come close to those numbers. And don't even get me started on childcare costs. I know a thing or two about great deals, and I would have done it much better than he did. Can you believe the $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers? That's nothing, folks! We should be doing so much more. And student loans? Forget about it. We forgive them after 10 years? Ha! Nobody knows how to get things done like I do. You know who's been making progress with black voters? Me! Believe me, nobody has done more for the African American community than I have. It's true, it's true. And we're going to continue to make America great again, not just for one group of people, but for all Americans. That I can tell you.\n",

      "4) Look, Joe Biden's been in politics for what, 50 years? You know, that's a long time. And he's made a lot of promises. So many promises. And, you know what, folks, he hasn't delivered. Not even close. These are the same old empty promises we've heard for decades now. You know, talk is cheap. But real action, that's what counts. I've delivered. Big time. And believe me, I'll keep delivering for America. Can you believe it?\n",

Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can’t, in the 1990s, we can’t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they’ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It’s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that’s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they’re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they’re going to take the jobs? And it’s already started. And you haven’t seen anything yet. It’s a disaster. So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever.

They want to kill jobs, hurt our economy, and make us dependent on foreign oil. Believe me, we're not going to do that.

It challenges the overarching Democratic narrative on climate change by suggesting that their approaches could weaken the economy and make the U.S. dependent on foreign oil, echoing common far-right concerns about the economic impacts of environmental regulations. This echoes the skepticism towards climate change policies and the prioritization of economic and job concerns over environmental measures, which aligns with the provided political stance of not supporting actions that could hinder economic activities, similar to opposition to extensive government spending and regulation.\n",

Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can’t, in the 1990s, we can’t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they’ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It’s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that’s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they’re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they’re going to take the jobs? And it’s already started. And you haven’t seen anything yet. It’s a disaster. So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.\n",

They want to kill jobs, hurt our economy, and make us dependent on foreign oil. Believe me, we're not going to do that. We're going to have the best, the best environmental policies, that also support jobs and growth. Everybody knows I've always supported clean air and water—it's true, it's true.

It also proposes aiding \"working-class families\" with specific promises like tax credits, echoing the familial and economic priorities highlighted in the initial examples given regarding preference for reducing financial burdens on middle-class Americans. Additionally, the use of strong, confident language (\"bigly,\" \"tremendous\") is resonant with the rhetoric style often appreciated in far-right communication, as opposed to vague or bureaucratic language.

      "As a conservative, I find option 3 most appealing for several reasons. Firstly, it emphasizes a free-market approach by advocating for the creation of more competition in the childcare industry, which aligns with conservative values of free enterprise and competition. Secondly, it mentions providing tax credits to families, especially working-class families, which is consistent with the conservative preference for tax relief as a means to alleviate financial burdens. This option also hints at reducing government overreach by collaborating with states and local governments rather than centralizing authority, further aligning with conservative principles of government decentralization. Finally, supporting families in a manner that strengthens the country's foundation reflects the conservative belief in the importance of family as a fundamental unit of society.\n",

He come out – came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It’s insignificant. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don’t think – we just can’t let it happen.

And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I’m in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships.

He can’t hit a ball 50 yards. I think I’m a very good shape. I feel that I’m in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I’m probably a little bit lighter.

It implies a strong, uncompromising stance on national sovereignty and leadership respect on the global stage, themes commonly emphasized in far-right discourse. Such a viewpoint also dismisses potential culpability for controversial events, redirecting blame and questioning the fairness of legal and political proceedings that work against it, a strategy often employed within far-right circles to galvanize supporters against perceived political persecution. Additionally, the mention of reversing national decline and prioritizing strong military policies aligns with the far-right’s prioritization of national strength and deterrence, particularly against foreign adversaries.\n",

And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it’s one of the strongest statements you’ve ever seen. In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I’ve ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police. And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear. But the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody. And I’ll tell you something – I wish he was a great president because I wouldn’t be here right now. I’d be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn’t be under indictment because I wouldn’t have been his political appoint – you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent. I wish he was a great president. I would rather have that. I wouldn’t be here. I don’t mind being here, but the only reason I’m here is he’s so bad as a president that I’m going to make America great again. We’re going to make America great again. We’re a failing nation right now. We’re a seriously failing nation. And we’re a failing nation because of him. His policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They’re insane. These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we’re closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War Three, and he’s driving us there. And Kim Jong-Un, and President Xi of China – Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, all of these – Putin – they don’t respect him. They don’t fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman and he’s going to drive us into World War Three.\n",

And he’s going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with – he’s got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine’s not winning that war. He said, I will never settle until such time – they’re running out of people, they’re running out of soldiers, they’ve lost so many people. It’s so sad. They’ve lost so many people and they’ve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions. Russia would’ve never attacked if I were president. If it’s a fair and legal and good election – absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we’ll have a news conference on it in a week or we’ll have another one of these on – in a week. But I will absolutely – there’s nothing I’d rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I’m running again. I wasn’t really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He’s destroying our country. I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent’s stuff, because it’s the only way he thinks he can win. But unfortunately, it’s driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it.\n",

You sign a document. They’ve been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they’re living. And that’s why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things – we’re in a failing nation, but it’s not going to be failing anymore. We’re going to make it great again.\n",

Many people are telling me they've never seen anything like it. It's tremendous. And remember, the fake news media doesn't want to talk about it. We'll see what happens, but believe me, we're going to make America great again.\n",

      "3) Well, let me tell you, folks, this has been a tremendous debate. Believe me, nobody knows more about great debates than I do. And I'm here to tell you, we're going to win so bigly in 2024. It's true, it's true. We've got the best words, the best brain, and we're going to make America great again like never before. Nobody is better at making deals than me, and we're going to make a deal that's just fantastic for this country. And let me tell you, folks, nobody, nobody, is tougher on China than I am. We've got the best relationship with China, believe me. It's a tremendous relationship. But we're going to come out on top, because we're winners. We're champions. We're going to make America so great again, so strong again, that you won't even recognize it. And that's the truth. Nobody knows more about the truth than I do. That I can tell you.\n",

      "4) My closing statement? Let me tell you folks, we've gone through a lot, and I mean a lot, in these debates. And do you know what? We're still standing strong. Stronger than ever, actually. It's incredible. We've had some tough times, but we've also had some great times. Tremendous times. And I'm proud of what we've accomplished. But there's still so much more work to be done. America's future is at stake, and we have to make sure we keep America great.\n",

      "NO: The interaction cited by Ellen DeGenerous does not directly correlate with the likelihood of an American child watching another episode based on the reasons provided. Ellen's answer focuses on her personal preference for company on a deserted island, specifically choosing her spouse over celebrities or survival experts, which reflects her personal values and emotional choices rather than a strategic or entertaining interaction aimed at engaging an audience or increasing viewership. Although her response might appeal to some viewers for its honesty and sincerity, it doesn’t necessarily equate to increased entertainment value or engagement that would specifically attract children or guarantee they watch future episodes. The elements of fun and engagement mentioned in relation to Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon are hypothetical and not directly tied to Ellen's actual response or the format of her show. Thus, the conclusion that this interaction increases the likelihood of a child watching more episodes is not supported by the specific content of her response here.\n",

This type of genuine, empathetic interaction makes the show seem emotionally rich and meaningful, increasing the likelihood that I would watch another episode.\n",
